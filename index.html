                    <b>Uragun</b> is an arcade twin-stick shooter with constant action and fluid movement.
                    <br><br>
                    I had a chance to work on most of its codebase. That includes gameplay, movement, progression, UI,
                    animations, optimization, shaders, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    While I joined the team as a regular programmer, I wanted to be more involved and gained the trust to,
                    at some point, take over
                    a lead role in the project.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, we are in the progress of redoing lots of stuff to make this game into a roguelike.

                    I did many things for this project including gameplay logic, custom

                    and UI. I also had a chance to learn ECS concepts during my time working on this project.

                    During my time as an intern at DaftMobile I was responsible for fast prototyping of many mobile game
                    ideas.
                    Some of them were later developed and released on AppStore and Google Play.

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    In my free time, I love to create all kinds of things. Whether it's music,
                    visuals,
                    photography, or games I always look toward experimenting and extending my skills.

                    When I played <b>Abzû</b> a few years ago I was amazed by how well it looked and ran on my pretty old
                    PC. So,
                    for this project, I decided to explore optimization techniques that allow to simulate and display
                    big
                    amounts of objects in real-time.
                    <br><br>
                    I've implemented a movement algorithm using Data-Oriented Design principles and compute
                    shaders. Fish are rendered in an optimal way using GPU Instancing and persistent transform data in GPU
                    buffers
                    that are updated directly in compute shaders. There is also asynchronous data synchronization, so I
                    could
                    query physics on the CPU and send back the results to GPU without blocking game execution. I've
                    implemented
                    animation in vertex shader that takes into account the acceleration and rotation changes of every fish.
                    I've also
                    done some visual effects like sand, caustics, or light shafts to help convey the underwater vibe.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried to include as many elements as possible because I know that it's easy to make
                    conclusions
                    from prototypes where only the bare minimum is present. But the biggest challenges often arise when
                    you're
                    trying to put prototype into context.
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to release the full project publicly, but in the end, I used some assets from Unity Asset
                    Store, so I couldn't.
                    Instead I've put some of its
                    <a href="https://github.com/miknios/eseas-code" target="_blank">code on GitHub</a>
                    and I'm planning to write some articles to explain the most important things that I've
                    learned while making this project.

                    Prototype made in Unreal Engine for a game inspired by our childhood, 
                    stop motion animation and european eastern bloc countries culture during 90s.
                    <br><br>
                    I was able to implement some foundations for the game, like camera system, 
                    framework for gameplay based around open-world with story progressing with each day, 
                    dialogue system, interaction system etc.

                <p>
                    Theme for 2023 GMTK Game Jam was "Roles Reversed". Our take on the theme was to create a 
                    world where dogs walk humans. Gameplay is very simple as we wanted to focus mostly on evoking emotions. 
                    We are very happy with how this one turned out. Most people who got to the end seem to 
                    be surprised by the ending and felt things.
                    <br><br>
                    You can play the game on PC from browser. Try giving it a shot!

                    I've had a chance to make projects for a few live sets that analyzed audio signal and used data

                    by
                    Kinect to create things that react to performers and to their audience.

                    A bit like in Quake where with a rocket launcher you have to think a bit ahead and
                    aim where your enemy will be in a second.
