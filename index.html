                    <b>Uragun</b> is an arcade twin-stick shooter with constant action and fluid movement.
                    <br><br>
                    I had a chance to work on most of its codebase. That includes gameplay, movement, progression, UI,
                    animations, optimization, shaders, etc.
                    <br><br>
                    While I joined the team as a regular programmer, I wanted to be more involved and gained the trust to,
                    at some point, take over
                    a lead role in the project.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, we are in the progress of redoing lots of stuff to make this game into a roguelike.

                    I did many things for this project including gameplay logic, custom

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
                    In my free time, I love to create all kinds of things. Whether it's music,
                    visuals,
                    photography, or games I always look toward experimenting and extending my skills.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, as a side
                    project, I'm making a prototype for a Roguelite VR game with vampires, motorcycles, and a lot of
                    shooting.
                    The
                    goal is to learn Unreal Engine, its rendering optimization techniques and to make something
                    cool
                    for
                    myself and others to enjoy.
                </p>

                <h2 class="stuff">Here's some of the stuff that I've made:</h2>

                <h1 class="side-info">Atlantis</h1>
                <h2 class="side-info">Thesis project</h2>

                <p>
                    When I played <b>Abzû</b> a few years ago I was amazed by how well it looked and ran on my pretty old
                    PC. So,
                    for this project, I decided to explore optimization techniques that allow to simulate and display
                    big
                    amounts of objects in real-time.
                    <br><br>
                    I've implemented a movement algorithm using Data-Oriented Design principles and compute
                    shaders. Fish are rendered in an optimal way using GPU Instancing and persistent transform data in GPU
                    buffers
                    that are updated directly in compute shaders. There is also asynchronous data synchronization, so I
                    could
                    query physics on the CPU and send back the results to GPU without blocking game execution. I've
                    implemented
                    animation in vertex shader that takes into account the acceleration and rotation changes of every fish.
                    I've also
                    done some visual effects like sand, caustics, or light shafts to help convey the underwater vibe.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried to include as many elements as possible because I know that it's easy to make
                    conclusions
                    from prototypes where only the bare minimum is present. But the biggest challenges often arise when
                    you're
                    trying to put prototype into context.
                    <br><br>
                    I wanted to release the full project publicly, but in the end, I used some assets from Unity Asset
                    Store, so I couldn't.
                    Instead I've put some of its
                    <a href="https://github.com/miknios/eseas-code" target="_blank">code on GitHub</a>
                    and I'm planning to write some articles to explain the most important things that I've
                    learned while making this project.

                    I wanted to explore the possibilities of visually reacting to things that happen during a show in real-time.
                    <br><br>
                    I've had a chance to make projects for a few live sets that analyzed audio signal and used data
                    captured
                    by
                    Kinect to create things that react to performers and to their audience.

                <p>
                    Theme for 2023 GMTK Game Jam was "Roles Reversed". Our take on the theme was to create a 
                    world where dogs walk humans. Gameplay is very simple as we wanted to focus mostly on evoking emotions. 
                    We are very happy with how this one turned out. Most people who got to the end seem to 
                    be surprised by the ending and felt things.
                    <br><br>
                    You can play the game on PC from browser. Try giving it a shot!

                <p>
                    Idea was to create FPS where you don't shoot directly at your opponent, but instead to traps that are
                    everywhere around. A bit like in Quake where with a rocket launcher you have to think a bit ahead and
                    aim where your enemy will be in a second.
                    <br><br>
                    I've made a prototype, but sadly because of lack of time
                    at that moment it was abandoned.

                    Hello! My name is <b>Mikołaj Wójcik</b> and I'm a <b>game programmer</b>. <br>
                    As a generalist, I'm not specialized in any specific field. I love to create all kinds of
                    things and I'm eager to learn new skills and take on challenges.
                    <br><br>
                    My game dev experience is based mostly on projects made in Unity. I'm using it professionally for over 4
                    years
                    now. Regardless, as a quick learner, I don't feel tied
                    to a specific game engine. For me, game development concepts are rather universal, so I'm always open
                    to other technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    Feel free to explore projects that I had a chance to work on in the "works" page.
                    <br><br>
