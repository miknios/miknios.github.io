                    <b>Uragun</b> is an arcade twin-stick shooter with constant action and fluid movement.
                    <br><br>
                    I had a chance to work on most of it's codebase. That includes gameplay, movement, progression, UI,
                    animations, optimisation, shaders etc.
                    <br><br>
                    While I joined the team as a regular programmer, I wanted to be more involved and gained trust to,
                    at some point, take over
                    a lead role in project.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently we are in progress of redoing lots of stuff to make this game into a roguelike.

                    I did many things for this project including gameplay logic, custom
                    shaders
                    and UI. I also had a chance to learn ECS concepts during my time working on this project.

                    During my time as an intern in DaftMobile I was responsible for fast prototyping of many mobile game

                    In my free time I love to create all kinds of things. Either it’s music,
                    visuals,
                    photography or games I always look towards experimenting and extending my skills.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently as a side
                    project I’m making a prototype for Roguelite VR game with vampires, motorcycles and a lot of
                    shooting.
                    The
                    goal is to teach myself Unreal Engine, it’s rendering optimisation techniques and to make something
                    cool
                    for
                    myself and others to enjoy.

                <p>
                    When I played <b>Abzû</b> few years ago I was amazed by how well it looked and ran on my pretty old
                    PC. So,
                    for this project I decided to explore optimisation techniques which allow to simulate and display big
                    amounts of objects in real time.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve implemented movement algorithm using Data-Oriented Design and compute
                    shaders. Fish are rendered in optimal way using GPU Instancing and persistent transform data in GPU
                    buffers
                    that are updated directly in compute shaders. There is also asynchronous data synchronisation, so I
                    could
                    query physics on CPU and send back the results to GPU without blocking game execution. I’ve
                    implemented
                    animation in vertex shader that takes into account acceleration and rotation changes of every fish.
                    I’ve also
                    did some visual effects like sand, caustics or light shafts to help convey the underwater vibe.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried to include as much elements as possible, because I know that it’s easy to make
                    conclusions
                    from prototypes where only the bare minimum is present. But the biggest challenges often arise when
                    you're
                    trying to put prototype into context.

                <p>
                    I wanted to explore possibilities of visually reacting to things that happen during a show in real
                    time.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve had a chance to make projects for a few live sets that analysed audio signal and used data
                    captured
                    by
                    Kinect to create things that reacts to performers and to their audience.

                    <source data-src="video/fps.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>
                    Idea was to create FPS where you don’t shoot directly to yout oponent, but instead to traps that are
                    everwhere around. A bit like in Quake where with rocket launcher you have to think a bit ahead and
                    aim where your enemy will be in a second. 
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve made a prototype, but sadly because of lack of time
                    at that moment it was abandoned.

                    Hello! My name is <b>Mikołaj Wójcik</b> and I'm a <b>game programmer</b>. <br>
                    As generalist I'm not really specialised in any specific field. I love to create all kinds of
                    things and I’m eager to learn new skills and take on challenges.
                    <br><br>
                    My gamedev experience is based mostly on projects made in Unity. I'm using it proffesionally over 3 years
                    now. Regardless, as a quick learner, I don’t feel tied
                    to specific game engine. For me game developement concepts are rather universal, so I’m always open
                    to other technologies.
                    <br><br>
                    Feel free to explore projects that I had a chance to work in the "works" page.
                    <br><br>
                </p>
