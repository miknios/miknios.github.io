                    I’m responsible for implementation of many things in twin-stick shooter game <b>Uragun</b>:
                    gameplay,
                    movement, progression, UI, animations, optimisation, shaders etc. While I joined the team as a
                    regular
                    programmer, I wanted to be more involved and gained trust to, at some point, take over a lead role
                    in
                    project.

                    In my free time apart of playing games I love to create all kinds of things. Either it’s music,
                    visuals,
                    photography or games I always look towards experimenting and extending my skills.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently as a side
                    project I’m making a prototype for Roguelite VR game with vampires, motorcycles and a lot of
                    shooting.
                    The
                    goal is to teach myself Unreal Engine, it’s rendering optimisation techniques and to make something
                    cool
                    for
                    myself and others to enjoy.

                    When I played Abzû few years ago I was amazed by how well it looked and ran on my pretty old PC. So,
                    for this project I wanted to explore optimisation techniques which allow to simulate and display big
                    amounts of objects in real time.
                    <br><br>
                    I’ve implemented movement algorithm using Data-Oriented Design and compute
                    shaders. Fish are rendered in optimal way using GPU Instancing and persistent transform data in GPU
                    buffers
                    that are updated directly in compute shaders. There is also asynchronous data synchronisation, so I
                    could
                    query physics on CPU and send back the results to GPU without blocking game execution. I’ve
                    implemented
                    animation in vertex shader that takes into account acceleration and rotation changes of every fish.
                    I’ve also
                    did some visual effects, so the enviroment feels like underwater.
                    <br><br>
                    I tried to include as much elements as possible, because I know that it’s often easy to make
                    conclusions
                    from prototypes where only the bare minimum is present, but biggest challenges often comes when you
                    try
                    to
                    put something in context.

                    I wanted to explore possibilities of visually reacting to things that happen during a show in real
                    time.
                    I’ve had a chance to make projects for a few shows that analysed audio signal and used data captured
                    by
                    Kinect to create things that subtly reacts to performer and also to audience.

                    <source data-src="video/fps.mp4" type="video/mp4">

                <p>
                    Idea was to create FPS where you don’t shoot directly to yout oponent, but instead to traps that are
                    everwhere around. A bit like in Quake where with rocket launcher you have to think a bit ahead and
                    aim
                    where
                    your enemy will be in a second. I’ve made a prototype, but sadly because of lack of time at that
                    moment
                    it
                    was abandoned.

                    Hello! I’m a game developer generalist who loves to create all kinds of things. I’m eager to learn
                    new stuff and take on challenges.
                    <br><br>
                    I’m experienced mostly in Unity, but as a quick learner I don’t feel tied
                    to single game engine. For me game developement concepts are very universal, so I’m always open to
                    other
                    technologies.
                    <br><br>
